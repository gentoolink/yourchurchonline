This includes pastor approval on all sermon summaries, accuracy checks for Scripture citations, and language guided by the church's specific style guide (e.g., reverent, invitational, clear).

For instance, churches that adopt online giving, which they facilitate through Tithely, typically see a 32% increase in donations.

      <div class="faq">
        <details>
          <summary>What is the core mission of the Digital Mission Toolkit?</summary>
          <p class="tiny">The Digital Mission Toolkit is a service designed to help Christ-centered churches extend their reach online and effectively proclaim the Gospel in the digital space. Its mission is deeply "Rooted in Scripture" and focused on "Serving the Great Commission" by providing a "Stewardship-wise" solution for online communications. This means they handle the technical aspects of digital outreach, allowing church leaders to concentrate on their primary roles of teaching, shepherding, and discipleship, ensuring the church's message continues to impact people throughout the week, not just on Sunday.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What services are included in the standard Digital Mission Toolkit package?</summary>
          <p class="tiny">The standard Digital Mission Toolkit, priced at $399/month, offers a comprehensive set of services aimed at establishing and maintaining a consistent online presence. This includes weekly website updates (sermons, announcements, events), transcription of sermons into SEO-optimized content, setup of online giving powered by Tithely (through a referral program), and weekly sermon-based email content that is ready to be dropped into a newsletter. The package also includes ongoing support and guidance, ensuring churches have a steady online rhythm without adding extra burden to their staff or volunteers.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>How does the Digital Mission Toolkit transform a weekly sermon into ongoing discipleship content?</summary>
          <p class="tiny">The Digital Mission Toolkit employs a "Sermon → Discipleship Content" workflow to ensure the Gospel message extends beyond Sunday. Churches provide their weekly sermon (audio or video), which is then transcribed and edited. This content is transformed into an SEO-optimized blog post, with key pull quotes extracted for social media. Additionally, sermon-based material is prepared for a weekly shepherding email. This multi-touchpoint strategy keeps the message alive Monday through Saturday, providing valuable resources for spiritual growth and engagement throughout the week. All content undergoes pastor approval to maintain the church's unique theological voice and integrity.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>How does the Digital Mission Toolkit ensure content integrity and theological alignment with individual churches?</summary>
          <p class="tiny">The Digital Mission Toolkit has a strong "Content Integrity Pledge" and a "Scripture-first workflow" to ensure alignment with each church's theological voice. They explicitly state that they honor the doctrinal voice of each church and nothing is published without review and approval from the pastor or a designated staff member. This includes pastor approval on all sermon summaries, accuracy checks for Scripture citations, and language guided by the church's specific style guide (e.g., reverent, invitational, clear). They align with the historic, orthodox Christian faith as expressed in creeds like the Nicene and Apostles' Creeds and are committed to reflecting the specific theological voice of the evangelical denominations they serve.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What are the financial benefits and flexibility of using the Digital Mission Toolkit?</summary>
          <p class="tiny">The Digital Mission Toolkit offers "Simple, All-Inclusive Pricing" at $399/month, designed to be a predictable fee that protects staff time and avoids piecemeal costs. They emphasize "Faithful stewardship" by noting that a unified digital strategy often pays for itself through increased generosity and engagement. For instance, churches that adopt online giving, which they facilitate through Tithely, typically see a 32% increase in donations. The service also offers significant financial flexibility with no long-term contracts; all plans are month-to-month, requiring only 30 days' notice for cancellation. This allows churches to grow their ministry and add optional services as needed, such as full newsletter management or website hosting and maintenance.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What is the Digital Mission Toolkit's approach to technology and church staff involvement?</summary>
          <p class="tiny">The Digital Mission Toolkit prioritizes "Ministry over machinery," handling the technical complexities so church leaders can focus on their core ministry functions like teaching, shepherding, and prayer. They provide a "fractional communications team" that manages website hosting, security, content publishing, and email creation. While they offer comprehensive support, they also design their services to be "Volunteer-friendly," equipping church teams with simple checklists and training videos for tasks like sending out weekly emails. Their aim is to make digital outreach accessible and efficient, whether managed entirely by them or with some involvement from church volunteers, without adding stress.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Does the church maintain ownership of its website and content when using the Digital Mission Toolkit?</summary>
          <p class="tiny">Yes, the church absolutely retains full ownership of its digital assets. The Digital Mission Toolkit explicitly states, "You do. Your church retains 100% ownership of your domain, website, and all content we create for you." This commitment ensures that churches are not locked into their service. If a church ever decides to leave, the Digital Mission Toolkit team will assist in packaging and transferring all content and the website to a new provider, ensuring a smooth transition and continuous control over their digital presence.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What optional add-on services are available beyond the core Digital Mission Toolkit package?</summary>
          <p class="tiny">Beyond the comprehensive core package, the Digital Mission Toolkit offers several optional add-on services to cater to growing ministry needs. These include "Full Newsletter Management" (from $149/month), where they handle list management, campaign sending, and deliverability. "Website Hosting & Maintenance" is available for $49/month, providing secure and reliable hosting with a single point of contact. Churches can also request "Custom Projects," which are quoted individually, for specific needs like event landing pages, graphics, or outreach campaigns. These add-ons allow churches to scale their digital strategy effectively as their ministry expands.</p>
